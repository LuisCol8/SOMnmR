# How to use the package SOMnmR

[Back to the Main page](README.md)

## Basic example

Here we want to just load the data (NMR spectra) and do a simple integration

```bash
# load necessary packages
  library(devtools)

# load data

# integrate data
# Here we can choose between "4region", "Bonanomi" and "MMM". I will chose 4 region.



```
