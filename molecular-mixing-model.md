# Molecular Mixing Model

The original paper from Nelson et al. (1999), used an amalgam of pure compounds as references. The  lignin is  assumed to be equivalent to  the average of those acquired for spruce and red alder lignin  presented by Wilson (1987), and the lipid is calculated from structures proposed by Kolattukudy (1980).

### Table 1. Reference compounds for natural soil organic matter, as published by Nelson et al. (1999).

A subsequent paper from Baldock et al (2004), uses a modified version of this, adjusted for terrestrial, and aquatic ecosystems. Here it is considered for cabohydrates a cellulose model, for protein based on extractable aminoacids from Friedel and Scheller (2002).

Later Nelson et al. (2005), published another set of reference compounds, which consider the carbohydrate and the protein fraction are based on the hexose and aminoacid composition described above and in Nelson (1999).

I have incorporated Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5 into the SOMnmR package as: "Terr_Nelson", "Aqua_Nelson", "Terr_Baldock" and "Aqua_Baldock", respectively.
